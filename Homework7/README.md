# EE475 Compression Lab
This repository houses the EE475 Compression Lab work, offering a practical exploration of various compression algorithms and their effects on image quality.

## Overview
The lab exercises delve into different compression algorithms and evaluate their impact on image quality. The activities involve responding to specific questions, supplying explanations, and utilizing the VC Demo program to scrutinize image processing functions. 

## Algorithms Explored
A focus is placed on several main algorithms and techniques:

- **Sub-sampling**
- **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)**
- **Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM)**
- **Vector Quantization (VQ)**
- **Discrete Cosine Transform (DPCM)**
- **JPEG**

## Tasks and Questions
Each algorithm comes with a set of tasks to be performed using different parameters. The tasks are coupled with related questions, exploring topics such as:

- Identifying and interpreting spectral line structures in image spectrums.
- Investigating the influence of anti-aliasing filters in subsampling.
- Assessing image quality and Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at various bit rates using PCM.
- Contrasting the performance of PCM and DPCM.
- Studying the utilization of different prediction models in DPCM.
- Understanding Vector Quantization's performance with different codebooks.
- Exploring the JPEG algorithm with varying entropy codings and normalization matrices.
- Examining the Discrete Cosine Transform with variable block sizes.
