# EE475 Fall 2018 - Homework 1

This repository contains my solutions and codes related to the Image Processing and Analysis Homework 1 for the EE475 course offered in Fall 2018.

## Tasks 

This homework consists of several tasks:

### 1. Image Read & Write; Histogram Plot

- Reading and displaying an image `COLOR_Birds.bmp`.
- Writing the image array to disk with a `.png` extension and viewing its metadata.
- Extracting RGB color components and plotting them separately.
- Creating a new grayscale image by averaging the RGB components.
- Plotting the histograms of the R, G, B, and gray-level components.
- Locating specific pixel colors in the image and creating binary representations.
- Adjusting grayscale pixel values and discussing the resulting changes.
- Identifying the "reddest" point in the image.

### 2. Average Optical Density (AOD)

- Reading a set of face images.
- Calculating the Average Optical Density (AOD) of the images.
- Plotting the histogram of the face images.
- Adjusting the AOD value and displaying the resulting images.
- Changing the luminance range of the gray image by applying multiplication and addition operations.

### 3. Amount of Digital Image Data to be Processed

- Discussing the amount of image data to be processed in a variety of scenarios such as a driver assistant system, medical imaging, industrial inspections, and digital cinema.

### 4. Pixels Varieties

- Analyzing the images representing different data types: self-luminous object, range camera capture, material density image, thermal image, and sequence of images.

### 5. Image Quantization

- Loading and manipulating the "lena.bmp" image.
- Experimenting with the most and least significant bits.
- Observing the distortion when different order bits are set to zero.
