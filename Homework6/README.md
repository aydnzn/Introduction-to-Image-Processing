# EE475: Digital Image Processing (Fall 2018) - Homework 6

This repository contains the sixth homework assignment for the course EE475 - Digital Image Processing, Fall 2018. This homework is dedicated to exploring and implementing various morphological operations and understanding their effects on different image structures.

## Overview

1. **Morphological Erosion**: The task is to erode an image with various structural elements provided in the assignment description. The center of each structural element is highlighted in red.

2. **Problem 9.6 a, b, c**: This involves solving and implementing the solutions for parts a, b, and c of problem 9.6 from the course textbook.

3. **Morphological Opening and Closing**: The goal here is to obtain the opening and the closing of a given figure using a 3x3 structuring element of 1's.

4. **Use of MATLAB's Morphological Operations**: In this task, you are required to use MATLAB with a defined structural element (se = strel('dis', 11, 0)) to perform a task as per problem 9.17 from the course textbook.

5. **Image Analysis Using Morphological Operations**: An image containing circles and squares of various sizes is given. The goal is to answer several questions about the image contents using morphological and logical operations. These questions range from identifying white pixels in the image, to counting the number of objects, identifying holes, and differentiating between squares and circles.

Refer to the individual problem sections for more details and specific instructions.
